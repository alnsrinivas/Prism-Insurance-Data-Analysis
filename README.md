📊 Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd. | Performance & Claims Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd., transforming over 10,000 rows of raw insurance data into a high-impact, interactive dashboard. As a third-year B.Tech student, I developed this project to demonstrate end-to-end expertise in data cleaning, validation, and professional business intelligence.

The analysis focuses on three core pillars: Financial Growth (Premiums), Risk Exposure (Coverage), and Operational Efficiency (Claims Status).
